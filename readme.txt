Integrate Swipp's social intelligence platform and measure sentiment on your WordPress site or blog.

== Description ==

Swipp is a **social intelligence platform** with solutions you can use to measure sentiment and drive better decision-making.

Give your audiences a voice
* Let customers and prospects tell you what they think. Swipp adds social smarts to your websites, emails, and apps – gathering information you can use to make better decisions.
* Capture timely feedback. Gather insight when it matters most – at the moment your audiences see your content.
* Build loyalty and engagement. Delight your customers by giving them a simple, direct way to make themselves heard.

Social intelligence is knowledge gathered directly from customers, providing insight into what they think about topics related to your business. We envision a world where every interaction has a social component, creating a dialogue between the people who create products and content and the people who consume it.

This rapid feedback channel will inform virtually all business activities, from the earliest phases of product design through marketing, advertising, sales, and customer service. Swipp brings businesses and their customers closer together, breaking down barriers between companies and their customers. The result? More meaningful outcomes, products, and services.
